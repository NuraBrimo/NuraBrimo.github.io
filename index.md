## About Me

I’m Nura Brimo, a Ph.D. student in Biomedical Engineering at Duke University. I hold an MPhil in Biomedical Engineering from Başkent University, an MSc in Entrepreneurship from Bartın University, an MSc in Micro & Nanotechnology from Middle East Technical University, and a BSc in Bioengineering from Kırıkkale University. My academic research has resulted in patents, peer-reviewed publications, and multiple gold medals at global invention expos. Beyond academia, I have led R&D initiatives with nonprofit and industry partners, focusing on health technology innovations and emergency response systems. 

## Research Interests

I am interested in cell and nuclear biomechanics/mechanics, nanomedicine, and AI/ML for brain cancer research.
